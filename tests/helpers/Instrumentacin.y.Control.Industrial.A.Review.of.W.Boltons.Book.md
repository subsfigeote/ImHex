The book consists of 15 chapters, each one focusing on a different aspect of industrial instrumentation and control. The first chapter introduces the concepts and terminology of measurement and control systems, such as accuracy, precision, resolution, range, error, feedback, and stability. The second chapter discusses the types and characteristics of sensors and transducers, such as temperature, pressure, flow, level, force, displacement, and speed sensors. The third chapter explains the principles and operation of signal conditioning circuits, such as amplifiers, filters, converters, and isolators.
 
The fourth chapter describes the various types of actuators and final control elements, such as valves, motors, pumps, solenoids, relays, and pneumatic and hydraulic devices. The fifth chapter covers the basics of control theory and methods, such as open-loop and closed-loop control systems, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, tuning methods, frequency response analysis, and stability criteria. The sixth chapter introduces the concepts and techniques of digital control systems, such as sampling, quantization, z-transforms, discrete-time controllers, state-space models, and digital filters.
 
The seventh chapter deals with the design and implementation of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which are widely used in industrial automation. The chapter explains the hardware components, programming languages, software tools, and applications of PLCs. The eighth chapter presents the fundamentals and applications of distributed control systems (DCSs), which are networked systems that allow centralized monitoring and control of multiple processes. The chapter discusses the architecture, communication protocols, data acquisition systems (DASs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADAs) of DCSs.
 
The ninth chapter explores the role and features of industrial communication systems, such as serial buses (RS-232/485), field buses (CAN/Profibus), Ethernet (TCP/IP), wireless networks (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/ZigBee), and optical fiber networks. The tenth chapter examines the use and benefits of computer systems in industrial automation, such as personal computers (PCs), embedded systems (microcontrollers/microprocessors), graphical user interfaces (GUIs), operating systems (OSs), databases (SQL), software engineering (UML), and artificial intelligence (AI). The eleventh chapter reviews the standards and regulations that govern the safety and quality of industrial instrumentation and control systems, such as ISO 9000/14000/27000/31000 series, IEC 61508/61511/62443 series, ANSI/ISA 5/18/84/88 series, and OSHA 1910/1926 series.
 
The twelfth chapter provides an overview of some emerging technologies and trends in industrial automation, such as smart sensors/actuators, internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data analytics, machine learning, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cyber-security. The thirteenth chapter illustrates some practical examples and case studies of industrial instrumentation and control systems in various sectors, such as chemical/petrochemical, pharmaceutical/biomedical, food/beverage, water/wastewater, power generation/distribution, and manufacturing/assembly. The fourteenth chapter offers some useful tips and guidelines for troubleshooting and maintenance of industrial instrumentation and control systems, such as fault diagnosis, testing methods, calibration procedures, and preventive/corrective actions. The fifteenth chapter summarizes the main points and key concepts of the book and suggests some further readings and resources for those who want to deepen their knowledge and skills in industrial instrumentation and control.
 
InstrumentaciÃ³n y Control Industrial is a comprehensive and informative book that covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of industrial automation. The book is well-written and well-organized, with clear explanations, numerous
